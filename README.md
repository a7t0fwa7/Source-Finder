# Source-Finder

this simply searches your PC for files that end with .hpp, .cpp, .h

the purpose of this was to make it grab all of them upload to an gofile api and send it to an attacker

i didnt finish this fully as im too lazy and also don't wanna make something ready for every one to use, you can finish it your self.
